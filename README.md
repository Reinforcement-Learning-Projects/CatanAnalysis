# CatanAnalysis [IN PROGRESS]
A Statistical Analysis of The Settlers of Catan Boardgame

## Aim
The aim of this project is to automate gameplay of The Settlers of Catan and hopefully decide which strategies lead to the highest probablity of winning.  

Some questions to answer:
* What is the best position to begin placing settlements in?
* Where is the best position to place your settlements in at the begining?
* Under what circumstances is largest army a better goal than longest road?
* When should you build on a harbor?
* Trading?

In the least, I hope to make the program represent the boardgame as closely as possible (some aspects will be very difficult and probably will be ignored) and allow for 3 to 4 players to play by their own set of algorithmic strategies.
